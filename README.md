# ourFLTrust


We reproduce the FLTrust model based on the paper "FLTrust: Byzantine-robust Federated Learning via Trust Bootstrapping"

We implement the FLTruest model in two datasets: MNIST and Fashion-MNIST.
To train the FLTruest model on MNIST, run ''' python run_MNIST.py'''.
To train the FLTruest model on Fashion-MNIST, run ''' python run_FashionMNIST.py'''.
